Right Click Modifier is an addon that allows you to modify the behavior of right clicking in game. You can enable or disable right click targeting, as well as double click targeting, in and out of combat. You can also set a value for the time between double clicks. This behavior affects units and objects.  

Common uses for this addon:  
* Disabling right click targeting in combat will prevent you from accidentally losing your target  
* Disabling right click targeting out of combat will prevent you from accidentally pulling a boss with your auto attack as a Hunter  

These situations generally occur when trying to move your character and screen with right click mouse movement.
